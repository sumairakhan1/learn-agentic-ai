### **Project 03: Browsing AI Agent: Your Next-Gen Answer Engine!**  

---

#### **Objective:**  
Saving time we spend daily on Online Search with an AI agent that transforms how users handle complex queries. Your agent will break down questions, search smarter, and combine results into the perfect answer—like a pro!  

---

#### **Why This Project Rocks:**  
Inspired by **Perplexity Pro Search** and ideas from **Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman**, this project helps you create an AI agent that redefines how people interact with information. As Suleyman said, *“This is the next browser, the next search engine!”*

#### **Requirements:**  

1. **Break It Down: Query Decomposition**  
   - Teach your agent to **split complex questions into smaller, actionable tasks**.  
   - Example:  
     *Question:* *"What are the top 3 hiking destinations in Asia and the best travel options?"*  
     - **Task 1:** Find top hiking destinations in Asia.  
     - **Task 2:** Search for travel options to those destinations.  

2. **Run Searches Like Lightning: Parallel Execution**  
   - Execute sub-tasks **simultaneously** to save time.  
   - Gather results from all tasks efficiently for faster processing.  

3. **Smart Responses: Result Synthesis**  
   - Combine results into a **clear, concise answer**.  
   - Use the LLM to:  
     - Filter irrelevant data.  
     - Organize and summarize the most relevant findings.  

4. **Engage Users Dynamically**  
   - Add **progress tracking** to keep users in the loop:  
     - Show steps like:
       - *"Searching for destinations..."*
       - *"Analyzing travel options..."*
       - *"Summarizing results..."*  

5. **(Optional) Go Pro with Real-World Tools**  
   - Integrate external APIs for more advanced queries, such as:  
     - **Wolfram Alpha** for math/science.  
     - **Flight APIs** for real-time travel prices.  
     - **Google Search API** for broader data retrieval.  

---

#### **Deliverables:**  
- A functional AI agent that can:  
  1. Decompose complex queries.  
  2. Execute sub-queries in parallel.  
  3. Provide synthesized, accurate answers.  
  4. Optionally, connect to real-world tools for richer results.  
- Include examples and a short demo or screenshots showcasing your agent’s capabilities.

#### **Example Scenarios:**  

1. **Travel Guru:**  
   - User: *"What are the top family vacation spots in Europe, and the best hotels under $200?"*  
   - Agent:  
     - **Breaks query into:**  
       1. Search for top family vacation spots in Europe.  
       2. Search for hotels under $200 at each location.  
     - **Combines results:**  
       - "1. Paris: Hotel Eiffel ($180); 2. Venice: Casa Bella ($150); 3. Prague: Royal Inn ($190)."  

2. **Shopping Assistant:**  
   - User: *"Find the best gaming laptops under $1,500 and where to buy them."*  
   - Agent:  
     - **Breaks query into:**  
       1. Search for top gaming laptops under $1,500.  
       2. Find online stores with available stock.  
     - **Synthesizes:**  
       - "1. Razer Blade 15 ($1,499 on Amazon); 2. Alienware m15 ($1,450 on Best Buy)."  

3. **Research Partner:**  
   - User: *"What are the latest developments in renewable energy since 2018?"*  
   - Agent:  
     - **Breaks query into:**  
       1. Search for advancements in renewable energy.  
       2. Filter results for the period after 2018.  
     - **Outputs:**  
       - "Solar efficiency has increased by 25%. Wind turbines are now 30% cheaper due to new materials."
