https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents/blob/main/all_agents_tutorials/essay_grading_system_langgraph.ipynb

An automated essay grading system using LangGraph and an LLM model evaluates essays based on relevance, grammar, structure, and depth of analysis, streamlining assessment processes in educational settings.

Utilizes a state graph to define the grading workflow, incorporating separate grading functions for each criterion. The system employs conditional logic to determine the flow of the grading process based on interim scores, with a final weighted average calculation.

You are going to take this base project and enhance it's functionality.

Note: You are free to use any other LLM APIs as well.
