A Travel Planner using LangGraph demonstrates how to build a stateful, multi-step conversational AI application that collects user input and generates personalized travel itineraries.

Utilizes StateGraph to define the application flow, incorporates custom PlannerState for process management, and employs node functions for city input, interests input, and itinerary creation. The system integrates an LLM to generate the final personalized travel itinerary.

You are going to take this base project and enhance it's functionality.
