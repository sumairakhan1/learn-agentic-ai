# GIF Animation Generator using LangGraph and DALL-E

https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents/blob/main/all_agents_tutorials/gif_animation_generator_langgraph.ipynb


A GIF animation generator that integrates LangGraph for workflow management, GPT-4 for text generation, and DALL-E for image creation, producing custom animations from user prompts.

Utilizes LangGraph to orchestrate a workflow that generates character descriptions, plots, and image prompts using GPT-4, creates images with DALL-E 3, and assembles them into GIFs using PIL. Employs asynchronous programming for efficient parallel processing.

You are going to take this base project and enhance it's functionality.

Note: You are free to use any other LLM APIs as well. For example you may use [Imagen 3](https://deepmind.google/technologies/imagen-3/)
