# Building an Intelligent Text-to-Speech Agent 

https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents/blob/main/all_agents_tutorials/tts_poem_generator_agent_langgraph.ipynb

An advanced text-to-speech (TTS) agent using LangGraph and OpenAI's APIs classifies input text, processes it based on content type, and generates corresponding speech output.

Utilizes LangGraph to orchestrate a workflow that classifies input text using GPT models, applies content-specific processing, and converts the processed text to speech using OpenAI's TTS API. The system adapts its output based on the identified content type (general, poem, news, or joke).

You are going to take this base project and enhance it's functionality.

Note: You are free to use any other LLM APIs as well.
