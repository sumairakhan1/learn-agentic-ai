# Text Analysis Pipeline Project

https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents/blob/main/all_agents_tutorials/langgraph-tutorial.ipynb

This project introduces LangGraph, a powerful framework for creating modular, graph-based AI workflows. You will learn how to leverage LangGraph to build more complex and flexible AI agents that can handle multi-step processes efficiently.

Step-by-step project on using LangGraph to create a StateGraph workflow. The tutorial covers key concepts such as state management, node creation, and graph compilation. It demonstrates these principles by constructing a simple text analysis pipeline, serving as a foundation for more advanced agent architectures.

Note: You are free to use any other LLM APIs as well.
