# Build a Quiz System

Build a Quiz System where the agent generates a quiz, the user (student) attempts the quiz. 

I questions.py file is included just so that you are able to understand what kinds of Questions are to be included in the system.

The Teacher/admin defines the title and description of the quiz, the agent generates the table of content consisting of chapters, topics, and subtopics. The questions are then generated which belong to topics and subtopics.

Tables of content and questions are approved by the admin/teacher.

When the student logs into the system he/she is presented with a series of questions. The result not only calculates the overall score, but score in each chapter, topic, and subtopic.

This result is stored and admin/teacher can view the average score in chapters, topic, and subtopic. Which can be drilled down to individual scores.

Note: You are free to use any LLM APIs you want.
