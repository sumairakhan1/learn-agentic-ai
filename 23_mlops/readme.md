[Real-World ML Systems on Kubernetes](https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-ml-systems-on-kubernetes)

We will learn how to use Ray, Kubeflow, Airflow, Spark, JupyterHub, and Keycloak along with Kubernetes to deliver best-in-class MLOps.

Note that MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) can include **AI agent deployment** as part of its scope. While traditional MLOps primarily focuses on the lifecycle of machine learning models, the deployment and operationalization of **AI agents** share many similarities and additional complexities that MLOps frameworks can address:

### How MLOps Applies to AI Agent Deployment:
1. **Model Training and Fine-Tuning**:
   - Like ML models, AI agents often rely on fine-tuned language models or multi-modal models. MLOps facilitates efficient training, fine-tuning, and experimentation workflows.

2. **Version Control**:
   - MLOps ensures that AI agent code, prompts, logic, and fine-tuned models are version-controlled and reproducible.

3. **Deployment Pipelines**:
   - AI agents can be deployed using CI/CD pipelines, similar to ML models, ensuring seamless deployment to production environments like Kubernetes or serverless platforms.

4. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - AI agents require observability to monitor behavior, performance, and user interactions. MLOps tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and MLFlow can help monitor response quality and usage metrics.

5. **Feedback Loops**:
   - Continuous improvement of AI agents involves retraining or tweaking models based on user interactions. MLOps frameworks support active learning workflows and closed-loop retraining.

6. **Scaling**:
   - AI agents often require real-time inference, which needs scalable infrastructure. MLOps facilitates horizontal scaling, load balancing, and efficient resource utilization.

7. **Compliance and Governance**:
   - AI agents interact dynamically, making ethical and regulatory compliance critical. MLOps includes governance workflows for transparency, reproducibility, and bias monitoring.

8. **Integration with Orchestration Frameworks**:
   - AI agents often operate as part of multi-agent systems or larger ecosystems (e.g., CrewAI, LangGraph). MLOps can streamline deployment and communication across agents and microservices.

### Tools to Extend MLOps for AI Agents:
- **LangGraph**: For building and managing agent reasoning and orchestration logic.
- **MLFlow**: For model tracking, experimentation, and deployment.
- **Kubernetes**: For scaling and managing agent containers.
- **Dapr**: To simplify inter-agent communication in distributed systems.
- **Ray Serve**: For scalable AI/ML deployment.

By integrating these tools and processes, MLOps can fully support the deployment and operationalization of AI agents while maintaining the efficiency, reliability, and scalability needed for production systems.
