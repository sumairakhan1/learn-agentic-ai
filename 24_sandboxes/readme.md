# Sandboxes

In the context of agentic AI, **sandboxes** like E2B and Modal provide secure, isolated environments where AI agents can execute code, perform tasks, and interact with external systems without affecting the host environment. These sandboxes are essential for testing, development, and deployment of AI applications, ensuring safety and security.

**E2B Sandbox:**

E2B offers an open-source runtime designed for executing AI-generated code within secure cloud sandboxes. These sandboxes are isolated virtual machines that can be rapidly initiated, typically in less than 200 milliseconds, providing a quick and efficient environment for AI agents. E2B supports various use cases, including AI data analysis, visualization, and running full AI-generated applications. Developers can control these sandboxes using E2B's JavaScript or Python SDKs, facilitating seamless integration into AI workflows. 

**Modal Sandboxes:**

Modal provides a platform that allows developers to create sandboxes for running arbitrary code in a safe and isolated environment. These sandboxes are particularly useful for AI agents that require executing code snippets or performing tasks that involve external dependencies. For example, Modal Sandboxes can be configured with specific dependencies, such as the `transformers` library, enabling AI agents to generate text with pre-trained models securely. The sandboxes support GPU acceleration and can be customized with necessary secrets and configurations, making them versatile for various AI applications. 

**Relevance to Agentic AI:**

In agentic AI, where agents operate autonomously to perform tasks, the ability to execute code safely and securely is paramount. Sandboxes like E2B and Modal provide the necessary infrastructure for these agents to run code, access the internet, and interact with external systems without compromising the host environment. This isolation ensures that any errors or unintended behaviors within the agent's code do not affect the broader system, thereby maintaining security and stability.

By utilizing these sandbox environments, developers can build and deploy AI agents capable of complex operations, such as data analysis, code generation, and interaction with external APIs, all within a controlled and secure setting.
