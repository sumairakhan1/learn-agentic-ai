Okay, I understand your internet connection is dropping every few minutes even after restarting your router. That's frustrating! Let's try a few more troubleshooting steps to isolate the problem. Please follow these instructions carefully and let me know the results after each step.

**First, let's gather some information to understand the situation better:**

1.  **What type of internet connection do you have?** (e.g., Cable, DSL, Fiber) Knowing this helps us understand potential causes.
2.  **What is the make and model of your router?** This will help me provide more specific instructions.
3.  **What devices are affected?** Is it happening on all devices (computers, phones, tablets) or just one?
4.  **When did this problem start?** Knowing when it began can help narrow down the cause (e.g., after a software update, new device installation, storm).
5.  **Are there any error messages displayed on your devices when the connection drops?** Note these down, as they can be very helpful.
6.  **Have you made any recent changes to your network configuration?** This includes changing router settings, adding new devices, or moving equipment.

**Now, let's proceed with the troubleshooting steps. Please complete each step before moving on to the next:**

**Step 1: Check the Modem**

*   **Power Cycle the Modem:** This is a more thorough reset.
    1.  Unplug the power cord from your **modem** (not just the router).
    2.  Wait for **60 seconds**. This allows the modem to fully reset.
    3.  Plug the power cord back into the modem.
    4.  Wait for the modem to fully power on and establish a connection (the lights should indicate a stable connection â€“ usually a "online" or "internet" light that's solid).  This can take several minutes.
    5.  Once the modem is online, test your internet connection.

**Step 2: Check the Ethernet Cable Connection (if applicable)**

*   If you are using a wired connection (Ethernet cable) between your computer and the router, or between the modem and the router:
    1.  **Inspect the cables:** Check for any physical damage (bends, cuts, loose connections).
    2.  **Reseat the cables:** Disconnect and reconnect the Ethernet cables at both ends (router, modem, and computer). Make sure they click securely into place.
    3.  **Try a different Ethernet cable:** If you have a spare cable, try using it to rule out a faulty cable.

**Step 3: Check Wi-Fi Interference (if using Wi-Fi)**

*   Wi-Fi signals can be affected by interference from other devices.
    1.  **Move closer to the router:** Test your connection close to the router to see if the drops still occur. If the connection is stable when close, interference is likely the problem.
    2.  **Identify potential sources of interference:** Common culprits include microwave ovens, cordless phones, Bluetooth devices, and other Wi-Fi networks. Try turning these off temporarily to see if it improves the connection.
    3.  **Change your router's Wi-Fi channel:** Routers typically operate on different channels. Using a less congested channel can improve performance.  To do this, you'll need to access your router's settings.  **Please tell me the make and model of your router and I can provide specific instructions on how to change the Wi-Fi channel.**

**Step 4: Test with a Direct Connection (Bypass the Router)**

*   This step helps determine if the problem is with your router or your internet service.
    1.  **Disconnect your router:** Unplug the Ethernet cable connecting your router to your modem.
    2.  **Connect your computer directly to the modem:** Plug the Ethernet cable directly from your computer to the modem.
    3.  **Restart your computer and the modem:** Restart both devices to ensure they recognize the direct connection.
    4.  **Test your internet connection:** If the internet is stable when connected directly to the modem, the problem is likely with your router.
    5.  **Important:** After testing, remember to reconnect your router!

**Step 5: Check Router Firmware**

*   Outdated router firmware can sometimes cause connection issues.
    1.  **Access your router's settings:** This usually involves typing your router's IP address (often 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1) into your web browser.
    2.  **Locate the firmware update section:** The location varies depending on the router's make and model. Look for options like "Firmware Update," "Software Update," or "Router Upgrade."
    3.  **Check for updates:** Follow the on-screen instructions to check for and install any available firmware updates.  **Again, telling me the make and model of your router will help me give you more specific instructions.**

**Step 6: Check for Other Devices Hogging Bandwidth**

*   Sometimes, other devices on your network can consume excessive bandwidth, causing drops for other devices.
    1.  **Identify bandwidth-intensive activities:** Check if anyone is streaming videos, downloading large files, or playing online games.
    2.  **Pause or limit bandwidth usage:** Temporarily stop or limit these activities to see if it improves the connection.
    3.  **Use Quality of Service (QoS) settings (if available):** Some routers have QoS settings that allow you to prioritize bandwidth for specific devices or applications.  **I can provide instructions for this if you give me your router model.**

**If none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide the information I requested at the beginning of this response.** With that information, I can give you more tailored advice and potentially suggest further troubleshooting steps, including contacting your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to investigate the problem from their end. It could be an issue with the line coming into your home.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security Software:** Sometimes, overly aggressive firewall or antivirus software can interfere with your internet connection. Try temporarily disabling them (one at a time) to see if it resolves the issue. **Be sure to re-enable them afterwards.**
*   **Router Age:** Routers have a lifespan. If your router is several years old, it might be time to consider replacing it.

Please work through these steps, and let me know the results. I'm here to help!
