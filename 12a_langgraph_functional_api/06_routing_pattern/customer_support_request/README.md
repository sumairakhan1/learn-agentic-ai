# Customer Support Request Router

Customer inquiries often varyâ€”from **billing concerns** to **technical issues** and **general questions**. A **routing pattern** improves response relevance by classifying each inquiry and delegating it to a specialized task.

### ** Key Steps**
1. **Define a Routing Schema**  
   - Create a **Pydantic model** specifying routing categories (e.g., `"billing"`, `"technical"`, `"general"`).  

2. **Implement a Router**  
   - Use an **LLM with structured output** to classify customer inquiries.  

3. **Specialized Response Tasks**  
   - Design separate tasks to generate category-specific responses.  

4. **Create a Routing Workflow**  
   - Dynamically route queries to the relevant specialized task.

This approach enhances scalability, improves response accuracy, and simplifies future refinements.
