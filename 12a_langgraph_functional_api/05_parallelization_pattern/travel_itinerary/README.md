# Travel Itinerary Generator  

## Overview  
The **Travel Itinerary Generator** is a **real-world example** of the **parallelization pattern** in AI workflows. It leverages **multiple LLM calls in parallel** to generate different itinerary components—**restaurant recommendations, tourist attractions, and hotel suggestions**—and then **aggregates** them into a **comprehensive travel plan**.  

## Why This Approach?  

- **Efficiency** – Parallel execution speeds up itinerary generation, making it ideal for travel apps.  
- **Diverse & High-Quality Content** – Each component is generated using specialized prompts for better recommendations.  
- **Scalability** – Easily extendable to include **local events, cultural tips, or additional travel insights** without major workflow changes.  

## How It Works  
1. **Break down** itinerary generation into independent sub-tasks.  
2. **Run multiple LLM calls in parallel** for restaurants, attractions, and hotels.  
3. **Aggregate** the results into a **well-rounded travel plan**.  

## Get Started  
```bash
uv run stream
```
