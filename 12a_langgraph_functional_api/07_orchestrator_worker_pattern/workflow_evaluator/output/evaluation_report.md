        * **Assistant Response:** "Certainly! To schedule a routine check-up, could you please provide me with your name and preferred date and time for the appointment?"
        * **Observations:** Positive (polite, professional, direct, clear). Areas for improvement (missing proactive info, generic question, no explicit confirmation).
    * **Run 2 (Appointment Inquiry - Confirming Existing Appointment):**
        * **User Input:** "Hello, I have an appointment scheduled, and I wanted to confirm the time and date, please."
        * **Assistant Response:** "Of course! To confirm your appointment, could you please provide your name and date of birth so I can locate your booking?"
        * **Observations:** Positive (polite, professional, direct, clear). Areas for improvement (missing confirmation of purpose, no alternative identification, no next steps indication).
* **Overall Observations from Iteration 1:**
    * **Strengths:** Politeness, professionalism, basic understanding of tasks.
    * **Weaknesses:** Reactive, lacks proactiveness, clarity can be improved.
    * **Alignment with Gold Standard:** Partially meets the standard (clear, professional), but needs improvement in instructions and conciseness for user experience.
* **Recommendations from Step 3:**
    * Implement proactive elements in responses to guide users more effectively.
    * Refine questioning strategies for more specific and helpful prompts.
    * Enhance clarity and explicitness in responses regarding purpose and next steps.
