# Poem Flow Manual

In this step we will take the default flow project generated by the CrewAI CLI and manually create Agents, Tasks, and Crews in pure Python code, instead of using YAML. There are two objectives to do this:

1. Increases our understanding of Agents, Tasks, and Crews
2. We believe writing pure Python Typed code is much better then defining Agents and Tasks in YAML. 


## Create Poem Flow Project

```bash
crewai create flow poemflow
```

## Add Key

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY=` into the `.env` file**
